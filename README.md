## Project information

Digital twin project MVP#1 is the first phase in creating a digital twin of the Al Shaheen field and is primarily focused around the DA platform. MVP#1 consist of three use cases:

### Use Case 1 - Digital twin cockpit 
A place to collect all use cases to support cross functional collaboration in addition to a set of dashboards for the Operations Center Manager to support more data driven decisions

### Use Case 2 - Integrated production optimisation
Full field gas lift optimization recommendations for the Onshore Operations Centre and Offshore Operations

### Use Case 3 - Work order bundling & risk visualisation
Removing waste from maintenance campaign planning through improved visualisation and supporting algorithms, allowing for faster convergence on the ideal plan reducing campaign shutdown time

MVP#1 phase of the project consisted of early stage development of PoC solution for all 3 use cases and took place in winter 2019/2020.
In the period April 2020 - July 2020, the Scale Up phase of the project took place with the objective for further development of the existing solutions and scaling them across NOC AL Shaheeh field.


## Getting Started

The project might have multiple repositories: `master`, `development`, etc. which contain code and documentation for different elements of the project delivery

### north-oil-company 


### noc calculations

### extractor-configs


### iam-bootstrap

### transformations

### sap-soap-extractor

### noc-uc2-dashboard

### uc3-data-dumps

### noc-uc2

### grafana-noc

The overall structure of the code repositories is as follows:
